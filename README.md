## Course Repository: "Research on Corporate Transparency"

This repository contains the publicly available materials of our open online course on Corporate Transparency. From the Syllabus:

This course is open for everybody who is interested in research on corporate transparency. It has been designed for Master and first year PhD students to get familiar with current research in this field and to take their first steps towards doing independent research on this topic. After completing the course, they will understand its main findings and have reviewed them critically. Also, they will be able to develop research projects that add to this fascinating and relevant field.
